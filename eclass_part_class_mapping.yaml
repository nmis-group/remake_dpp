        definition: Magnetic-inductive flow sensors, or MID for short, use a measuring
          method based on the law of electromagnetic induction. Coils arranged perpendicular
          to the direction of flow generate a magnetic field. A conductive fluid passing
          through the magnetic field induces a current between two electrodes, which
          can be used to measure a voltage.The induced voltage is proportional to
          the flow velocity

        name: Thermal flow sensor
        type: CATEGORIZATION
        definition: Thermal flow sensors (also known as calorimetric flow sensors)
          use the specific ability of a liquid or gaseous medium to transport a quantity
          of heat. Since the mass of the passing medium is essential for the removal
          of the heat quantity provided by a heating element, thermal sensors are
          also known as mass flow sensors. If the medium is known, the heat quantity
          transport depends only on the flow velocity, which is usually measured using
          the heat loss method or the heat transfer method. In the heat loss method,
          the temperature difference between a heater and a temperature sensor, both
          of which are usually designed as electrical resistors, is kept constant
          by the electrical regulation in a bridge circuit. The electrical power required
          to adjust the bridge to a constant temperature difference between the heater
          and the temperature sensor is a measure of the amount of heat lost by a
          flowing fluid and is therefore directly related to the flow velocity
